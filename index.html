<h2> Struggling with School but coping</h2>
<p class="aanddate">September 30,2022 by Gabrielle Scott</p>
<article>This week was the first time I have experienced so many academic lows in my life. Each hit knocked down my confidence till I started to question am I right for my degree. However I have taken my failures in stride,learned how to start managing my stressors and reasoned out my failures to adapt for future assignments.<br><img src="sq.jpg" align="right" width ="10%"></article>

<h2>Hurricane Ian</h2>
<p class="aanddate">September 25,2022 by Gabrielle Scott</p>
<article>Hurricane Ian approached my island Jamaica as a tropical storm over the weekend , it brought torrential showers of rain, a whistling breeze and an overwhelming feeling of drowsiness. Monday morning when I left home to go back to school,it was still raining cats and dogs; when I got the computer lab the ac was cooling the  place like ice in the freezer and the sounds outside room were like ocean waves. <br><img src="studentstudingunderw.png"  width ="10%"></article>
